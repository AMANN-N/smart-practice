Python Basics: Variables and Loops

1. Variables
A variable is a container for storing data values. In Python, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example:
x = 5
y = "John"

2. Data Types
Python has the following data types built-in by default:
- Text Type: str
- Numeric Types: int, float, complex
- Sequence Types: list, tuple, range

3. For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

4. While Loops
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
Example:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
